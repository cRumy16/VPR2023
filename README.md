# VPR2023
Visual Place Recognition Machine learning and Deep Learning group project (Computer Vision). 
This repository explores techniques for improving visual place recognition (VPR) starting from a codebase. The task is determining the location of a query image by retrieval from a database of geotagged images. Experiments evaluate the impact of different components like feature aggregators, mining strategies, and losses. We also implemented a self-supervised approach by using VICReg Loss (Unsupervised) with satisfiyng results.
